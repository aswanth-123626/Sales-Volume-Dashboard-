# Sales-Volume-Dashboard-
This is an Excel Project on Sales performance and Volume Analysis Dashboard 
I worked on a excel project on FMCG retail data.FMCG stands for fast moving consumer goods.
FMCG's products that are relatively low cost and sold quickly.

The objective of the project was to analyse the data and create dashboard for
 regular business performance tracking.
 first,i spent time on understating data.The data contained approx 50,000 records.
This included details of orders,product purchased,quantity and sales.
After that i worked on cleaning and preperation of the data.
I created column like margin and category.These details were available in a mapping sheet 
so i used index match function to bring the data.

i also derived profit column using sales and margin.
I also derived quarter and year columns.
I created two dashboards,the sales performance dashboard and volume analysis dashboard.

In the sales performance dashboard,i analysed store wise sales,category wise sales,
monthly sales trend,top selling products,region wise sales and profit.

In the volume analysis dashboard,i analysed store-wise quantity sold,category-wise quantity, 
monthly quantity trend and top 5 products by quantity.

Then i created pivot table,connected all the  pivot tables to slicers 
and used pivort chart to make the dashboard interactive.
